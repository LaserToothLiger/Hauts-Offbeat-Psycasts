						<description>Speak about becoming one with another while extracting mental essence from the listener to place it into a coma. The other target gains some of that mental essence, boosting its consciousness, though if the coma should ever be undone that essence will return to the listener. The benefit of this ability can stack up to ten times.\n\nThe listener must be conscious, but can be downed. The souls of children have a quality that renders them immune to this magic.</description>
